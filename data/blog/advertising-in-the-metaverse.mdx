As we usher in a new era in technological innovation, it's becoming apparent that brands and consumers will interact very differently in the Web 3.0 world - and the metaverse that is emerging from it. By blending physical with digital, we will see the rise of hybrid experiences where immersion, personalization and connectivity will become some of the key selling points.

And with new patterns of behavior and consumption slowly taking shape, brands will have to re-invent themselves to align with audiences in the metaverse. What is important to take note of is that the marketing of today will not translate well in a virtual world; from advertising to purchasing channels and the very nature of the interests of consumers, marketers and advertisers will face a new set of challenges.

The metaverse is being billed a trillion dollar market opportunity. Some brands with deep pockets like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren, are already carving out their influence in the metaverse - and making big money with their first forays into virtual worlds. Even for those who aren’t willing to commit just yet, brand experimentation has become a top trend to follow.

And while we’re just at the tip of this technological advancement, there are already real-world areas that can benefit from having a presence in a virtual world. Perhaps without much surprise, advertising and marketing are likely to become an even bigger industry in the metaverse given the new (and extremely profitable) avenues that are being opened up.

In this post, we will be discussing advertising in the metaverse, from the advertising channels of the future to the pros and cons of embracing this technological development.

What Is The Metaverse
The metaverse is a virtual space that blends real world and virtual realities into one, in real time, using emerging technology like virtual and augmented reality to create highly immersive 3D environments. Some are calling it the successor to the current internet, as the next big step in interactive digital experiences.

With a vast number of possibilities at play, the metaverse is quickly becoming an influential platform for socialization, creative pursuits, business, gaming, entertainment, and more.

Currently, the closest experience we have to the metaverse are gaming platforms like Roblox , Axie Infinity and Fortnite, as well as open-source virtual worlds, including Decentraland, and the Sandbox. These platforms offer shared 3D worlds where users can engage in a number of experiences beyond gaming.

In Sensorium Galaxy, for example, users will be able to attend music concerts and meet their favorite artists, as well as move within the many worlds within this metaverse, connecting with new people, exploring new forms of self-expression and exploration, creating dances and striking relationships with virtual AI-driven beings. Users will also be offered deep levels of customization of both their avatars and their experience with Sensorium Galaxy.

With virtual worlds becoming the new marketing and advertising frontier, there are a key metaverse concepts that advertisers will want to leverage:

Hyper social: opportunities to meet and connect with new people will become much bigger due to the shared nature of virtual worlds.

Scalability: Hundreds of millions of people (and their avatars) will be able to coexist, at the same time, in the metaverse.

Accessibility: All users, regardless of their age, background, religion or location, will be able to join the metaverse.

New forms of content: Immersive and interactive content generated by users and that can’t take shape in the real world, can finally emerge in the metaverse.

Bridge between physical and digital: Blurring the lines between both worlds allows people to interact with experiences, products and services in more compelling ways.
